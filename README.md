# Hi. I'm Max!

I've been developing software professionally since 2017. It feels like an entire lifetime has passed since, but somehow it's only been a few years?

## Current Employment

I'm currently employed at the wonderful [1Password](https://1password.com/careers), where you'll catch me posting multiple paragraph-long replies to simple questions, finding some new edge case that occurs when the tide is just right and you sneeze four times in a row, and sneaking into some merge request I wasn't tagged in but I thought looked interesting.

Oh. Also, I write tons of code. That's mostly what they hired me for. 

### What I Do

The current niche I have dug for myself is in writing strong Go code that's well architectured and higly testable. 
I'm also the local SQL/Data expert for my team, plan and lead multiple projects for my pod, and try my best to practice good [InnerSource](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-innersource/) with our platform and internal tooling teams.

My current big long-term project is splitting out a specific domain from a big monolithic Go app.

### What I've Done

Some of the accomplishments I'm most proud of in my work at the company so far are:
 * Jumping 3 major [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-ca) version upgrades with no major incident. (For what it's worth, I'd argued for step-by-step)
 * Finding the source of more than 5K daily database deadlocks + planning and leading the execution of a series of fixes in collaboration with two other teams while also giving clear and consistent progress to key stakeholders.
 * Leading the architecture and code refactoring of an existing service to migrate it to a new managed infratstructure solution.
 * Currently leading the technical implementation of a new domain platform away from a monolith wokring hand in hand with one of our Staff developers.

## Past Accomplishments

### Unity Multiplayer Services
I was involved in the planning, Alpha and Beta phase of two different products/services/SDKs in Unity's, one of which included the [Friends](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/manual/friends/manual/welcome) service.
Most of my work on that service was in figuring out the initial underlying graph database storage method and the integration with our Golang-based service.

The other product I worked on which sadly did not make it to release was (keeping it vague) a system involving a data store of some kind living near a game server that would be consistent across play sessions. 

### Ad Tech
I worked for an advertising technology company where I was a back-end developer for a time before moving to a data squad, where I and some others were in charge of:
 * Providing technical guidance to a group of 20+ developers on how to interact with our data.
 * Managing our fleet of MySQL and Vertica instances.
 * Running key data migrations and designing new data structures.
 * Building various data analysis pipelines and monitoring queries.
 * One of 3 developers who built a new data pipeline that took the multiple-hour long process of gathering ad impressions data to a < 15 seconds stream which allowed us to modernize our programmatic billing with up to date near-real time data.
